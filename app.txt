# Project-90-Brainstorming

#What's my app Idea?
So, my idea is to make a booking app which will help the users book a coworking space for some time.

#From where did I get this Idea?
My parent's were not able to focus properly while working because of their workspace. Also, the co-working space is running in loss because of the pandemic, and they also faced the problem of booking the slots and that resulted in losing them customers. So I decided to contact the co-working space and took out information, since many people are facing the same problem as my parents, I decided to make a booking-app to book the slots according to the users comfort.

#Functionalities of the app
It will help the user to book the slots according to their suffficient timings, how long they will use the co-working space, check the availability etc.
